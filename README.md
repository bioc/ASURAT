# ASURAT

ASURAT is a computational pipeline, implemented in the R programming language, for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis.
Using ASURAT, one can simultaneously perform unsupervised clustering and biological interpretation in terms of cell type, disease, biological process, and signaling pathway activity.

Below is a vignette, in which we analyze public scRNA-seq data of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
