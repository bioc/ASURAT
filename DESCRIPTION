Description: ASURAT is a computational pipeline for single-cell data analysis,
    which simultaneously performs unsupervised clustering and biological
    interpretation in terms of cell type, disease, biological process, and
    signaling pathway activity. Inputting a single-cell RNA-seq data and
    knowledge-based databases, some of which have already been prepared,
    ASURAT transforms read count tables into an original multivariate tables,
    termed a sign-by-sample matrices (SSMs). Analyzing SSMs, one can cluster
    samples (cells) to aid their interpretation.
